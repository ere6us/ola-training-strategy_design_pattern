# ola-training-strategy_design_pattern

This was a tutorial from Week 2, Day 4. Here we majorly learned following:

    1. Code for supertype. Don't code for subtype. In other words, code for interface, not for implementation.
    2. Prefer composition instead inheritance. In other words, prefer has-a relationship over is-a relationship.
    3. Encapsulate what varies.
    4. This design pattern is strategy design pattern.
